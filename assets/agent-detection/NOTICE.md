They are evaluated by `src/agent_rules.rs`, which is a port of herdr's
`src/detect/manifest.rs` (same manifest schema, region slicing, and gate
semantics) so that the packs keep working exactly as upstream intends.

## Updating

Use `markup integration update-rules` to download upstream packs into the per-user update cache. Markup validates each manifest and its `min_engine_version`, chooses only newer compatible remote packs, and keeps local overrides in `~/.config/markup/agent-detection/` as the highest-precedence source. New custom agent packs in that local directory can add aliases and screen rules without Rust changes.
`index.toml` is upstream's registry; this crate instead auto-discovers every
`agent-detection/*.toml` embedded under `assets/`.

If the packs are ever distributed as part of a binary release, include the full
Apache-2.0 license text alongside them, as the license requires.
